A website (Streamlit) to help construction workers have better access to mental health care. With an implement of semi-AI bot chat (Botpress), the workers can feel less intimidated, at least before getting connected to a psychiatrist.

The chat bot will give a decent analyst of how many users have accessed to it, how many returners, or new accesses.
