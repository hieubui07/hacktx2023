#hacktx2023

A website (Streamlit) to help construction workers have better access to mental health care. With the implementation of semi-AI bot chat (Botpress), the workers can feel less intimidated, at least before getting connected to a psychiatrist.

The chatbot will give a decent analysis of how many users have access to it, how many returners, or new accesses.
